# 2023Spr_projects
It is the final project for UIUC IS 597 pr. Created by Xinmai Xuan (xinmaix2).
It is an ongoing project and might finished in following 2-3 weeks.

- Ramdon Variables:
Due to the real game rules and workload consideration, I listed all possible random variables that might be used in this final project. The Random variables 1 and 2 will definitely appear as random variables. Random 3 and 4, indtead, might be set as constant variables based on the workload and complexity of other projects. 	
Random Variables 1: The number of points obtained by rolling two dice. It should be simulated as triangular.
Random Variables 2: The resource distribution of each resource’s bricks.
Random Variables 3: The chance of earning resource of each resource’s bricks. 
Radmon Variables 4: The distributions of harbors.

- Prerequest for this Monte Carlo Simulation:
Each simulation describes the whole game process. Starting from default resources, two dice are rolled repeatedly to represent each turn. During each turn, the user could make actions such as trade with bank, trade with port, and building instructions including road, settlement, and city.  
We do not account for robber, player of development card, largest army, longest road, and any trade with other players. 
Simulation would stop when the player collect 10 points using settlements and cities.
